Commmands to make the Scanner:
(If making directly from the Scanner.x Alex file)

alex --ghc Scanner.x 
ghc -fno-warn-tabs Scanner.hs

(Otherwise, from the Haskell file)

ghc -fno-warn-tabs Scanner.hs


Commands to make the Parser:
(If making directly from the Parser.y Happy file)

happy --ghc Parser.y
ghc Parser.hs

(Otherwise, from the Haskell file)

ghc Parser.hs


Commands to compile the whole thing and link it all together:
ghc Main.hs

Special Directions:
Alex and Happy, tools included with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Package, must already be installed before making the Scanner/Parser from their Alex and Happy files respectively.
